     <p>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
     father charged you in his will to give me good
     education: you have trained me like a peasant,
     obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
     qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
     me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
     me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
     give me the poor allottery my father left me by
     testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</p>
    <h4  class =" name OLIVER">OLIVER<br></h4>
    <p>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
    Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
    with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
    pray you, leave me.</p>
    <h4 class="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO<br></h4>
    <p>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</p>
