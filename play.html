        <h1>GAHANA SWETHA SANAGALA PRESENTS</h1>
        <h2>SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house</h2>
        <p class ="stage-direction">Enter ORLANDO and ADAM<br></p>
        <h4 class="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO<br></h4>
        <p>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
        bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
        and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
        blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
        sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
        report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
        he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
        properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
        that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
        differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
        are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
        with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
        and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
        brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
        which his animals on his dunghills are as much
        bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
        plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
        me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
        me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
        brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
        gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
        grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
        think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
        servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
        know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</p>
        <h4 class="name ADAM">ADAM<br></h4>
        <p>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</p>
        <h4 class="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO<br></h4>
        <p>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
        shake me up.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">Enter OLIVER<br></p>
        
        <h4  calss =" name OLIVER">OLIVER<br></h4>
        <p>Now, sir! what make you here?</p>
        <h4 class = "name ORLANDO">ORLANDO<br></h4>
        <p>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</p>
        <h4 class = "name OLIVER">OLIVER<br></h4>
        <p>What mar you then, sir?</p>
        <h4 class ="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO<br></h4>
        <p></p>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
        made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</p>
        <h4 class ="name OLIVER">OLIVER<br></h4>
        <p>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</p>
        <h4 class ="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO<br></h4>
        <p>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
        What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
        come to such penury?</p>
